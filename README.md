# 📖 SSC & HSC Practical Workbook Images  
### A Little Piece of My Heart, Shared with You  

Hey there! I’m Nishat Mahmud, and this is my little corner of GitHub where I’ve poured out something really close to my heart — the **SSC and HSC Practical Workbook Images**. These aren’t just photos; they’re memories of late nights, pencil smudges, and that bittersweet feeling of finishing a practical only to hand it over for a tiny "3" marks. If you’re a science student like I was, you’ll get it. This repo? It’s for you, me, and anyone who’s ever felt a pang of love for those workbook pages.

## 🌱 What’s Here?  
Inside, you’ll find **498 photos** I took with my trusty **Canon IXY 200 PowerShot** — all crisp and clear, because blurry science just doesn’t cut it. They cover:  
- **Higher Math (1st & 2nd Paper)** - Those equations that made me question life.  
- **Physics (1st & 2nd Paper)** - Experiments that felt like tiny victories.  
- **Chemistry (1st & 2nd Paper)** - Mixtures and messes I secretly loved.  
- **Botany** - Plants that taught me patience.  
- **Zoology** - Animals I sketched with care.  
- **ICT** - Tech stuff I fumbled through but figured out.  
- **SSC Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Career Education** - The roots of my science journey.  

It’s about 2.82 GB of memories — each photo around 5.8 MB — and I’ve sorted them so you can find what you need without digging too deep.

## 💭 Why I Did This  
For years, I’d been dreaming of a way to hold onto my practical workbooks. As a science student, you put so much into them — the neat diagrams, the careful notes — and then poof, they’re gone, submitted in an exam hall. I hated that. Sure, lots of folks don’t even make their own these days, but for those of us who do, it’s personal. So, I decided to save mine and share them with anyone who might need them.  

This started on Facebook, where I first uploaded everything. But the resolution got squished, and 15 GB on Google Drive wasn’t enough. Now, here on GitHub, they’ve got a proper home — free for everyone, no copyright walls, just open hearts.

## ✨ A Little Story  
This all began as my quiet rebellion against losing something I worked so hard on. I’d sit there with my camera, snapping each page, thinking, “This matters.” And now, years later, it’s not just mine anymore — it’s ours. Every line, every sketch, it’s a piece of that journey I’m handing over to you.

## 🤗 Let’s Keep It Going  
If you’ve got your own practicals to add, or you use these in a way that sparks joy, I’d love to hear about it. Maybe:  
- Drop a **star** if this warms your heart.  
- Share your story in an issue or pull request.  
- Take it, twist it, make it your own.  
Let’s keep this little flame of curiosity burning together.
